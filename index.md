# The Uncommon Language Framework

The Uncommon Language Framework (ULF) Project aims to create a cross-platform, multi-paradigm, and general purpose programming framework inspired by .NET, complete with an object model, JIT compiler, and other high-level language features such as a garbage collector.

The ULF is currently still in the early development stage and does not implement all of its desired features.

The pages below contain more information about the ULF Project.
